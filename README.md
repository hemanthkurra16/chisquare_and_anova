# chisquare_and_anova
Chi-Square and ANOVA are vital statistical tools. Chi-Square assesses relationships between categorical variables, while ANOVA compares means among groups. Chi-Square is used to test independence or association, common in fields like epidemiology and marketing. ANOVA, on the other hand, helps identify group mean differences, crucial in experiments and research.
These methods aid in data-driven decision-making by unveiling insights and relationships within datasets, making them indispensable in diverse domains.


This assignment involves hypothesis testing, the utilization of critical values, and the examination of Chi-square assumptions to validate claims. The report encompasses tasks that entail both problem analysis and dataset evaluation. Through this assignment, we aim to grasp coding techniques essential for problem analysis and provide comprehensive explanations of how the specified assumptions are met.


By conducting Chi-square and ANOVA tests, we aim to assess the validity of claims, utilizing statistical tools and principles. This assignment not only serves as a means to acquire hands-on experience with data analysis but also provides insights into the methodologies required to
meet the underlying assumptions of Chi-square and ANOVA testing.
